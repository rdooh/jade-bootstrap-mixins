jade-bootstrap-mixins
=====================


Overview
--------

Twitter Bootstrap widgetry as Jade mixins.  Building this library for myself - may be slow to evolve - but someone else may find this useful.


Environment
-----------
This is meant to be general purpose - not a node package or anything.  Not anytime real soon.  Just the files, m'am, just the files.  I'm coding in Coda2, and compiling on-the-fly with CodeKit with Compass set up (hence the config.rb file).  

The *jade-bootstrap-mixin* library sits in build/Jade, as does an example file that should pull together a number of Twitter Bootstrap widgets, so you can see how to put them together.  At some point, I may bust the elements out into partials, but first things first... let's get started..
